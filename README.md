> [!NOTE]
> This is a basic, good starting point, ready to be used and add onto without being all bloated with thousands of line of code. Just under 500 lines of javascript!
>
> I did include the [tkrotoff/bootstrap-floating-label](https://github.com/tkrotoff/bootstrap-floating-label) plugin cause, I just like his floating labels more than the default bootstrap floating labels.
